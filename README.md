# Sales-Report-Excel

This is a simple Excel project I worked on to create a clean and easy to understand sales dashboard.

And the dashboard was designed using the following skills and tools:
- Microsoft Excel
- Excel Pivot Tables
- Excel Pivot Chart
- Data Cleaning/wrangling
- Slicers for easy filtering
- Summary of total sales, top products, and more
- Colour brewering for colour template ( https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=PuBu&n=3 )
